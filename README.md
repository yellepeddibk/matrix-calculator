# Matrix Calculator Web App | Flask, AWS, NumPy, PyQt5, Bootstrap

## Overview
The Matrix Calculator Web App began as a simple desktop application built with PyQt5 for performing essential matrix computations. Initially designed for quick calculations of determinants and Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF), the project evolved into a Flask-powered web application to enhance accessibility and scalability. 

The web version features a modern, responsive interface built with HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), and JavaScript. Although it was previously hosted on AWS EC2 with Nginx, Gunicorn, and SSL encryption, the AWS deployment is currently offline due to cost considerations. However, you should be able to run the Web App through your local host - instructions are below.

This project demonstrates robust input validation, comprehensive error handling, and efficient computation methods, ensuring a reliable user experience in both desktop and web environments.

## Features

### Desktop (PyQt5) Version
- **Standalone GUI:** A dedicated desktop application built with PyQt5.
- **Matrix Input Validation:** Ensures correct matrix values prior to computation.
- **Supported Operations:**
  - Determinant Calculation (for square matrices)
  - Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF)
- **Error Handling:** Provides clear notifications for invalid inputs.

### Web Version (Flask & JavaScript)
- **Modern Web Interface:** Developed using HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), and JavaScript for an intuitive user experience.
- **Matrix Computation API:**
  - `/api/determinant` – Computes the determinant of a given matrix.
  - `/api/rref` – Computes the Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF) of a given matrix.
- **Dynamic Input Fields:** Allows users to adjust matrix dimensions and input values on the fly.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensures compatibility across various devices.
- **Error Handling:** Returns informative messages for invalid or erroneous inputs.

### Deployment & Optimization (AWS - Previously Hosted)
- **Cloud Hosting:** Deployed on AWS EC2 for scalability.
- **Security:** Configured with Nginx as a reverse proxy and secured with SSL encryption.
- **Performance:** Optimized using Gunicorn to manage multiple concurrent users.
- **Maintenance:** Automated scripts monitor server health and optimize response times.
- **Status:** AWS deployment is currently offline due to cost considerations.
